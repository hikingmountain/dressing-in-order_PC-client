## Introduction
While browsing the github website, I came across the code of the paper,"Dressing in Order: Recurrent Person Image Generation for Pose Transfer, Virtual Try-on and Outfit Editing" and found its functions very useful, especially the try-on function. Nowadays, online shopping is very popular. When customers are shopping clothes online, they need a tool to try on the clothes they like. I think the dressing-in-order PC-client can meet their needs.
